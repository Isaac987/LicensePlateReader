## Introduction

The inspiration behind this project was to mimic the software used by my school for detecting which cars did not pay for parking. I wanted to dabble with machine vision and learn new tools such as OpenCV, Yolo, and Google Colab. 

## Features

This program can identify license plates and outline them with a border and confidence.

## Installation

Example installation in a Linux environment using Anaconda as a local environment.

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/Isaac987/PlateSpotter.git
2. cd PlateSpotter
3. conda create --prefix ./.venv
4. conda install pip
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
```
