# PlateSpotter

Plate Spotter is a license plate detection system which utilises the power of machine learning to identify a variety of different license plates from images, videos, and a live feed.

## Introduction

The inspiration behind this project was to mimic the software used by my school for detecting which cars did not pay for parking. I wanted to dabble with machine vision and learn new tools such as OpenCV, Yolo, and Google Colab. 

## Features

This program can identify license plates and outline them with a border and confidence.

## Installation

Example installation in a Linux environment using Anaconda as a local environment.

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/Isaac987/plate_spotter.git
2. cd plate_spotter
3. conda create --prefix ./.venv
4. conda install pip
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
```
